# DKB CSV to YNAB converter

DKB has switched to their new home banking system. It does not contain all the features of the old one. Unfortunately the features in regards to the CSV export were the ones that are not fully implemented yet. The features that are implemented, need some more time to mature. The move to the new banking system broke the CSV to QIF converter that I was using before. So I am writing my own converter, with Blackjack and hookers!
